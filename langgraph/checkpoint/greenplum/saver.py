"""Greenplum-optimized checkpoint savers.

Greenplum (and other MPP databases with similar planners) handle
correlated subqueries by broadcasting the entire inner table to all
segments (Broadcast Motion), which is extremely slow on large datasets.
These savers replace the default correlated subquery with a CTE + JOIN
approach that uses targeted Redistribute Motion instead.

Best suited for: Greenplum and other MPP databases that cannot
decorrelate subqueries and thus choose Broadcast Motion. Not all
PostgreSQL-based distributed databases have this behavior; use the
regular `PostgresSaver` / `AsyncPostgresSaver` when in doubt.

Requirements:
    Greenplum 6+ (based on PostgreSQL 9.4) or PostgreSQL 9.3+, since
    the CTE query uses `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`.

Usage::

    from langgraph.checkpoint.greenplum import AsyncGreenplumSaver

    async with AsyncGreenplumSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as saver:
        await saver.setup()
        # use as a drop-in replacement for AsyncPostgresSaver
